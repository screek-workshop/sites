The 1U can be customized further by making adjustments to the HLK-LD2410 sensor inside the device.  This chip is an ultra-low power radar sensor launched by Hilink.  To adjust the settings, you need to do 2 things:

1.	Make sure that you enable the LD2410 BLE sensor under the device configuration page that you reach by pressing VISIT when in the Homeassistant Device Info screen. There is a button to enable LD2410 BLE, and a log running down the right side of the page where you can confirm it is running.

2.  The HLK app called HLK Radar Tool.  This configuration software is a mobile app that gets a connection through BLE and radar. It has a visual interface for parameter adjustment and monitoring. On Apple, you can get it by searching **HLKRadarTool** in the app store. On Android, however, it needs to be installed manually. You can find it and install it at this link: [https://www.pgyer.com/Lq8p](https://www.pgyer.com/Lq8p)

Once the app is installed and the LD2410 BLE sensor is running, you can launch the app.  It should search for and find your device.  The password to log into the device is HiLink.  From this app, you can examine and make changes to the radar settings.  There is a YouTube video here demo the app:

This process of customization is optional, but it can fine-tune your sensor for issues such as detection range, sensitivity etc.
