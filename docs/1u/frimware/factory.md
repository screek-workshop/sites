From time to time, we provide firmware updates to enhance some of the sensor features and sometimes to improve stability.  
In general, if the sensor is working well, you can not need to pay attention to the new firmware.  

There are several firmware update methods, and we especially recommend OTA firmware updates:  

[OTA Update](index.md){.md-button .md-button--primary}

But if the original firmware is corrupted, then you will can need to reset everything to the firmware.It will need another update method.  
This is usually very uncommon.
