Thank to use **Screek Human Presence Sensor 1U**, here we want to help you to connect the sensor to Home Assistant quickly.

In case you're confused about our models, this is what 1U looks like.   
It is a small square box.  
We made a lot 1u radars and it is a DIY product we are very proud of.

A number of optimizations have been made to ensure that the entire connection is completed as quickly as possible.
