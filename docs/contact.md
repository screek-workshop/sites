## Message

### eBay Message

We recommend this method, it allows us to quickly understand the DIY products you have purchased and get your order information.  
We have experienced many times that our email replies have been placed in the wrong spam folder, making it impossible for us to respond in a timely manner.  

- You can also contact the US through your **Purchase history** by selecting **Contact seller** next to the item.

- And you maybe can contact us at our store page: On the home page of our eBay store, you can find a Contact button, click on it and you can get in touch with us.
