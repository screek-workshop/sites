## The Story

We love the possibilities of HomeAssistant, we were followers of commercial products, but after a while, we regretted that they were not customizable enough, and when we started to feel that HomeAssistant was so open and free, we embraced took it.
Soon, we found that based on it, there are so many possibilities and rich plug-ins that make HomeAssistant almost full of possibilities. We also want to add some of our own ideas, and we started this journey of exploration .
We hope to share with you some discoveries in this exploration process, and we hope to build some simple hardware devices to make it more complete and more interesting.

What makes us feel so magical? Those rich electronic gadgets like Arduino and Makebot can be connected with a family. Let HomeAssistant become more intelligent, and as we hope, it is full of freedom to define, you can modify the yaml configuration file of esphome to achieve the refresh rate you want, and the HomeAssistant node that suits your taste is very interesting things.
And it is also full of challenges, hardware selection, welding, picking out those excellent hardware, debugging the signal better, improving its stability, and finally, the most important thing, giving it a good-looking shell , which requires a lot of effort, what we share is our view on these things, a plan we designed. We hope to improve it together with you and make our home more intelligent.

How exciting all this is in a world where artificial intelligence is opening doors. We have an opportunity not only to passively accept the slow product improvement speed of those commercial products, but also to have some fences on various platforms. We can integrate some flexible and convenient components into our HomeAssistant. It's really amazing, isn't it?
It's been an amazing journey! Internet, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT, Chips, 3D Printing, Open Source...all the stuff.
