Welcome to the Screek Workshop.

Here are some of the little electronics we make, we are often asked how to use them, and how to get started quickly.    

Although we do a lot of software optimization, it seems that a document is always more helpful.    

So, we've put together some common questions here along with some getting started guides.    

## eBay Store
### U.S. Sites
For those of you who want to get our products, here is our eBay store:    

[https://www.ebay.com/str/screekworkshop](https://www.ebay.com/str/screekworkshop){.md-button .md-button--primary}

### Other Country eBay sites
We support shipping to all over the world, if you use another site on eBay, you can search **SCREEK** to find our products.

For example, on the eBay UK site (https://www.ebay.co.uk), you can search for SCREEK and find our human presence sensors.
